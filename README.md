# feature-test-example
Example of feature test approach (or my understanding of it).

Code quality is exceptionally low (was writing code as a fast as I probably could)
That is the point though - test untestable.

After main method is started, the application is accessible at: `http://localhost:4567/index`

# Functionality
Application allows to add "users" to the system and specify "password". There's some input data validation.
There're lots of bugs. Code quality is not great.
Enjoy!
